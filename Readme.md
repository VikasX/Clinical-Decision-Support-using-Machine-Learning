# Readme

In this project a, performance comparison between different machine learning algorithms: <i>Linear Regression, Random Forest, SVM,
k-NN and Artificial Neural-Net </i> on the <b>Wisconsin Breast Cancer datasets</b> is done. The main objective is to assess the
correctness in classifying data with respect to accuracy and efficiency of each algorithm.<br>
